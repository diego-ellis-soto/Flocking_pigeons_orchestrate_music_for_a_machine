#  Multiple, independently recorded trajectories covering different individuals over similar time ranges usually do not share the exact same sampling times. In reality, both sampling times and sampling rates differ across individual trajectories and over time. However, animations use a discrete speed for switching frames. Since moveVis needs to assign each location of a trajectory to a specific frame, the sampling times of all locations across all trajectories need to be aligned to share a uniform temporal resolution and uniform time stamps that can be assigned to frames. moveVis includes a dedicated function to align trajectories using linear interpolation, named align_move():

# Frames can be edited before animating them. moveVis provides a set of functions to customize the appearance of frames after they have been created.

# Animating trajectories on a dynamic NDVI base map
# Instead of using a default base map, the user can pass other imagery as raster objects to frames_spatial(). Such can be multi-band RGB data (e.g. aerial footage) or single-band data, either continuous (e.g. environmental indices or parameters) or discrete (e.g. a land cover classification). Moreover, the user can choose to pass a single raster image, which will then be used as a static base map, or a list of raster images which will result in a base map changing dynamically over time.
# For this example, four raster datasets, representing the Normalized Vegetation Index (NDVI) at four different dates within the time range of the 2018 White Stork migration, have been acquired for a spatial extent covering the migration trajectories. The datasets have been derived from the MOD13Q1 raster product, a vegetation indices product derived from reflectance data acquired by the Moderate-resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) satellite sensor operated by NASA. NDVI is an indicator for chlorophyll activity, ranging from -1 to 1, and can be used to derive vegetation presence and health. Low values (< 0.2) indicate no vegetation, moderate values (0.2-0.3) sparse and high values (> 0.3) dense vegetation.
# Since the NDVI rasters are stored in a single file, the raster data can be loaded as a stack and then unstacked into a list. The according acquisition times per raster are defined in a separate vector.
